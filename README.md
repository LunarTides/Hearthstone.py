# Hearthstone.py
This is a [Hearthstone.js](https://github.com/LunarTides/Hearthstone.js) recreation in Python.

Not to be confused with `Hearthstone.py V1` or `Hearthstone.py V2`, this is it's own thing.

This is currently very early in development and probably won't reach feature parity with hsjs, but I was bored...

## Running
1. Install [Python](https://python.org).
2. Do `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` file (`python3 main.py`) to run the game.

## Development
1. Do `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.
1. Format by doing `ruff format`.
2. Add pre-commit hook by doing `pre-commit install`.
3. If you are planning to open a pull request, try keeping the code modular and extendable. Take notes from how the current codebase does things.
